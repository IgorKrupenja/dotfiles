## Playwright MCP output files

Whenever a Playwright MCP tool takes a `filename` parameter, always prefix it with `.playwright-mcp/` (the server's default output folder) so files don't end up in repo roots. Example: `.playwright-mcp/my-shot.jpeg`, not `my-shot.jpeg`.

This applies to every tool with a `filename`, not just screenshots — `browser_take_screenshot`, `browser_snapshot` and `browser_evaluate` all accept one, and accessibility snapshots are the worst offenders (600+ line YAML dumps). Omitting `filename` is also fine: the server then writes into `.playwright-mcp/` by itself.
